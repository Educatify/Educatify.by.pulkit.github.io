Are you a new comer in python fields ?
And wanna learn Python and make carrier in it ?
Then be relaxed because you have reached a trustworthy tutor .</font>
Q-What is python ?‚òπ
->Python is just a programming language
just like ‚Äì C , C++ , etc. . It‚Äôs used to
design apps , games .
->In 1991 Guido Van Rossum made this language
<b>Introduction to Python</b>
</pre>
Python was created by Guido Van Rossum when he was working at CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) which<br> is a National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in
Netherlands. The language was released in I991. Python got its name from a BBC comedy series from seventies- ‚ÄúMonty Python‚Äüs Flying Circus‚Äù. Python can be used to follow both Procedural approach and Object Oriented approach of programming. It is free to use.
<br><br> 	
Some of the features which make
Python so popular are as follows:<font color=white><br>
-> It is a general purpose programming
language which can be used for both
scientific and non scientific
programming.<br>
->It is a platform independent
programming language.<br>
->It is a very simple high level language
with vast library of add-on modules.<br>
->It is excellent for beginners as the
language is interpreted, hence gives
immediate results.<br>
->The programs written in Python are
easily readable and understandable.
<br>
->It is suitable as an extension language
for customizable applications.
<br>->It is easy to learn and use. The
language is used by companies in real
revenue generating products, such as:
<br>->In operations of Google search engine,
youtube, etc.<br>
->Bit Torrent peer to peer file sharing is
written using Python
<br>->Intel, Cisco, HP, IBM, etc use Python
for hardware testing.<br>
->Maya provides a Python scripting API<br>
->i‚ÄìRobot uses Python to develop
commercial Robot.<br>

->NASA and others use Python for their
scientific programming task Introduction
to Data types <br>1. Number
<br>->This data type stores Numerical
Values. This data type is immutable i.e.
value of its object cannot be changed
(we will talk about this aspect later).
These are of three different types:
<br>a) Integer & Long
<br>b) Float/floating point
<br>c) Complex Range of an integer in
Python can be from - 2147483648 to
2147483647, and long integer has
unlimited range subject to available
memory.<br>

1.1 Integers are the whole numbers
consisting of + or ‚Äì sign with decimal
digits like 100000, -99, 0, 17. While
writing a large integer value, don‚Äüt use
commas to separate digits. Also integers
should not have leading zeros.<br>
1.2 Floating Point: Numbers with
fractions or decimal point are called
floating point numbers. A floating point
number will consist of sign (+,-)
sequence of decimals digits and a dot
such as 0.0, -21.9, 0.98333328, 15.2963.
These numbers can also be used to
represent a number in engineering/
scientific notation. -2.0/ 105 will be
represented as 2.0e5 2.0X10-5 will be
2.0E-5<br>

1.3 Complex number in python is made
up of two floating point values, one each
for real and imaginary part. For
accessing different parts of variable
(object) x; we will use x.real and x.image.
Imaginary part of the number is
represented by ‚Äûj‚Äü instead of ‚Äûi‚Äü, so 1+0j
denotes zero imaginary part.<br>
1.4 Boolean contains two values True,
False<br>
2. None This is special data type with
single value. It is used to signify the
absence of value/false in a situation. It is
represented by None.<br>
3. Sequence is an ordered collection of
items, indexed by positive integers. It is

combination of mutable and non
mutable data types. Three types of
sequence data type available in Python
are Strings, Lists & Tuples.
4. Set is an unordered collection of
values, of any type, with no duplicate
entry. Sets are immutable.<br>
5. Mapping: This data type is unordered
and mutable. Dictionaries fall under
Mappings<br>

Python doesn‚Äôt works on a simple text
editor like ‚Äì notepad , sublime , etc .
<br>It can be said that python has it‚Äôs own
text editor commonly known as <a href=https://www.python.org/downloads/ style='color:yellow'>IDLE</a>
